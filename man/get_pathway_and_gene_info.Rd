\title{Get Pathway and Gene Information}
\usage{
get_pathway_and_gene_info(pathwayID_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwayID_vec}{A character vector of pathway IDs. IDs should follow the format conventions
of their respective databases: GO IDs should start with "GO:", KEGG IDs should match the
pattern "hsa\\d+", and Reactome IDs should match the pattern "R-HSA-\\d+".}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{pathwayDescription_vec}: A character vector of pathway descriptions.
\item \code{PMID_vec}: A character vector of PMIDs for pathway references.
}
}
\description{
Retrieves detailed information about pathways and their associated genes from different databases
(GO, KEGG, Reactome) based on provided pathway IDs.
}
\details{
This function identifies the database source of each pathway ID and calls the appropriate
specialized function to retrieve information:
\itemize{
\item GO pathway information is retrieved using \code{get_go_term_info}.
\item KEGG pathway information is retrieved using \code{get_kegg_info}.
\item Reactome pathway information is retrieved using \code{get_reactome_info}.
}
The function merges information from all sources into a single result.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get information for a mix of GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathways
pathway_ids <- c("GO:0006915", "hsa04210", "R-HSA-109581")
pathway_info <- get_pathway_and_gene_info(pathway_ids)

# Access pathway descriptions
print(pathway_info$pathwayDescription_vec)

# Access reference PMIDs
print(pathway_info$PMID_vec)
}
