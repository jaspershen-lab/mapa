\usage{
merge_pathways_bioembedsim(
  object,
  sim.cutoff = 0.5,
  cluster_method = "louvain",
  hclust.method = NULL,
  save_to_local = FALSE,
  path = "result"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object containing functional enrichment result and similarity matrix.
The object must have \code{enriched_pathway} and \code{sim_matrix} components.}

\item{sim.cutoff}{A numerical value for similarity cutoff, default is 0.5. This is the similarity cutoff for pathways.
Only edges with similarity above the cutoff will be stored in the graph data.}

\item{cluster_method}{Character, clustering method options:  "louvain" (default), "hierarchical",
"binary_cut", "walktrap", "infomap", "edge_betweenness", "fast_greedy", "label_prop",
"leading_eigen", "optimal".}

\item{hclust.method}{Character, agglomeration method for hierarchical clustering including:
"ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median", "centroid".
Only used when \code{cluster_method = "hierarchical"}.}

\item{save_to_local}{Logical, whether to save intermediate results locally (default: FALSE).}

\item{path}{Character, directory to save results when save_to_local is TRUE (default: "result").}
}
\value{
Returns the updated enriched_pathway object with functional modules added.
The object will contain a new slot "merged_module" with:
\itemize{
\item graph_data: A tidygraph object representing the network of related pathways
\item functional_module_result: Data frame with module information and annotations
\item result_with_module: Data frame with raw results assigned to modules
}
}
\description{
Identifies functional modules by clustering pathways based on their biotext embedding similarity.
This function groups related pathways into functional modules using various clustering
methods including binary cut, Girvan-Newman, or hierarchical clustering.
}
\details{
The function takes biotext embedding similarity scores between pathways
and groups related pathways into functional modules.
It supports three clustering methods:
\enumerate{
\item Binary cut: Uses the simplifyEnrichment binary_cut algorithm
\item Girvan-Newman: Community detection based on edge betweenness
\item Hierarchical clustering: Groups pathways based on distance thresholds
}

The function handles GO terms, KEGG pathways, and Reactome pathways, combining
them into unified functional modules based on similarity.
