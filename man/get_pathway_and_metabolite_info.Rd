\title{Get Pathway and Metabolite Information}
\usage{
get_pathway_and_metabolite_info(pathwayID_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwayID_vec}{A character vector of pathway IDs. IDs should follow the format conventions
of their respective databases.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{pathwayDescription_vec}: A character vector of pathway descriptions.
\item \code{PMID_vec}: A character vector of PMIDs for pathway references.
}
}
\description{
Retrieves detailed information about pathways and their associated metabolites from different databases
(KEGG, SMPDB) based on provided pathway IDs.
}
\details{
This function identifies the database source of each pathway ID and calls the appropriate
specialized function to retrieve information:
\itemize{
\item KEGG pathway information is retrieved using \code{get_metkegg_info}.
\item SMPDB pathway information is retrieved using \code{get_smpdb_info}.
}
The function merges information from all sources into a single result.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get information for a mix of KEGG and SMPDB pathways
pathway_ids <- c("hsa00010", "SMP00001")
pathway_info <- get_pathway_and_metabolite_info(pathway_ids)

# Access pathway descriptions
print(pathway_info$pathwayDescription_vec)

# Access reference PMIDs
print(pathway_info$PMID_vec)
}
