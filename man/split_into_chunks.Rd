\title{Split Full Text into Manageable Chunks}
\usage{
split_into_chunks(
  full_text,
  max_chunk_length = 800,
  min_words = 5,
  space_threshold = 5,
  min_chunk_length = 50
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_text}{A character string representing the full text to be split into chunks.}

\item{max_chunk_length}{An integer specifying the maximum number of words allowed in a single chunk (default is 800).}

\item{min_words}{An integer specifying the minimum number of words a line must contain to be included in a chunk (default is 5).}

\item{space_threshold}{An integer specifying the minimum number of spaces in a line to consider it as a double-column text (default is 5).}

\item{min_chunk_length}{An integer specifying the minimum number of words required in a chunk to be included in the result (default is 50).}
}
\value{
A character vector where each element is a text chunk.
}
\description{
Splits a given full text into smaller chunks based on specified parameters such as maximum chunk length and minimum word count.
}
\details{
This function handles both single-column and double-column texts. Double-column texts are identified based on the number of spaces in a line (\code{space_threshold}). The function also filters out chunks containing references or URLs and ensures that only chunks with at least \code{min_chunk_length} words are included.

# Example: Split a full text into chunks
full_text <- "This is the first line.\nThis is the second line, which has more words.\n\nReferences\nThis line will be excluded."
chunks <- split_into_chunks(full_text)
print(chunks)
