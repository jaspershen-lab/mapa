\title{Retrieve Metabolic Pathway Databases}
\usage{
get_met_pathway_db(use_internal_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{use_internal_data}{Logical. Indicates whether to use internal (local) data for the KEGG pathway retrieval.
Note that the HMDB pathway retrieval currently does not support online access, so the \code{use_internal_data} parameter
is not applied for HMDB.}
}
\value{
A named list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{hmdb_pathway}{A list of HMDB pathways filtered to include only those classified as "Metabolic;primary_pathway".}
\item{kegg_pathway}{A list of KEGG pathways with disease-related pathways removed.}
}
}
\description{
This function retrieves metabolic pathway data from the HMDB and KEGG databases.
For HMDB, it obtains all pathways via \code{metpath::get_hmdb_pathway} and then filters to retain only primary metabolic pathways.
For KEGG, it downloads pathways using \code{metpath::get_kegg_pathway} (with the \code{use_internal_data} flag controlling local data usage)
and removes pathways related to diseases.
}
\details{
The function uses 3 threads for both HMDB and KEGG pathway retrievals.
\itemize{
\item For HMDB: After retrieving the pathways, the function extracts only those with the classification
"Metabolic;primary_pathway".
\item For KEGG: The function retrieves pathways for the human organism (specified by \code{"hsa"})
and filters out any pathway that contains the word "Disease".
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Retrieve pathway databases using internal data for KEGG
  pathways <- get_met_pathway_db(use_internal_data = TRUE)

  # Access HMDB pathways
  hmdb <- pathways$hmdb_pathway

  # Access KEGG pathways
  kegg <- pathways$kegg_pathway
}
