\description{
This internal function executes a PubMed search using query terms and pathway information,
with fallback strategies for handling failed queries. It implements a three-level search
strategy: first attempting a full query with all terms, then breaking into chunks if that
fails, and finally trying individual terms if chunk queries also fail.
